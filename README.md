## Abstract

Handwriting recognition is one of the compelling research works going on because every individual in this world has their own style of writing. Because everyone in the world has a unique writing style, handwriting identification is one of the fascinating research projects now being conducted. It is the ability of a computer to automatically recognise and comprehend handwritten numbers or letters.
Everything is being digitised to minimise human labour as a result of advancements in science and technology. Thus, handwritten digit recognition is required in many real-time applications. The MNIST data collection, which contains 70000 handwritten digits, is frequently utilised for this recognition method. In order to train these photos and create a deep learning model, we use artificial neural networks. A web application is developed that allows users to upload pictures of handwritten numbers. The model examines this picture and the detected result is returned to the UI.
